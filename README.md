# 📈 The Relationship Between Happiness, Technology, and Social Media 🌐

- Working Paper from Econometric Course

## 📖 Abstract
This article studies the impact of income and the use of technology and social media on happiness levels using the RPTBXS framework with data from the General Social Survey (GSS). Key findings include the diminishing returns of income on happiness at higher levels and the significant impact of social media on happiness, particularly at low and high levels. The study suggests that the government should establish a sound psychological guidance system to ensure smooth channels for psychological counseling and high group recognition.

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Income and Happiness**: The increase of income will not increase happiness when it is already high.
- **Technology and Happiness**: Technology use significantly impacts happiness, especially at high income levels.
- **Social Media and Happiness**: Social media significantly benefits happiness at both low and high levels.

## 📊 Methodology
- **Data Source**: General Social Survey (GSS)
- **Framework**: RPTBXS
- **Techniques**: Ordered logistic regression, instrumental variable, XGBOOST, SHAP, Bayesian Optimization

## 🧑‍🔬 Research Methods
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values with random forest in mice package and feature engineering with post-double-selection.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Examining the relationship between happiness, income, and technology/media.
- **Regression Analysis**: Logit regression, ordered logit regression, and TSLS to understand the impact of technology and social media on happiness.
- **Machine Learning**: BO-XGBOOST-SHAP model to explore correlations and variable importance.

## 📚 Data Availability
GSS data is used in this study, and is available online.
